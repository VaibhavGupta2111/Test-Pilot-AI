## Risk & Test Case Generator (Testpilot-AI)

An end-to-end tool that reads your issue backlog (Excel), computes risk scores (including linked-issue propagation), and auto-generates step-by-step QA test cases with expected outcomes. Ship faster, reduce manual toil, and maintain a consistent QA style across your team.

## üöÄ Features
Risk Scoring ‚Ä¢ Base priority + status score ‚Ä¢ 0.5√ó propagation from linked issues ‚Ä¢ Recursion-safe via memoization

Semantic Test-Case Outlines ‚Ä¢ FAISS + Sentence-Transformers search for similar issues ‚Ä¢ GPT-2 "outline" pipeline to draft concise step outlines

Refinement with Expected Outcomes ‚Ä¢ DistilGPT-2 "refine" pipeline adds ‚Äú‚úî Expected:‚Äù validations ‚Ä¢ Skips refinement for low-risk issues

Interactive Streamlit UI ‚Ä¢ Upload your Excel, filter by risk, preview results ‚Ä¢ Real-time progress bar during test-case generation ‚Ä¢ Download scored issues & test cases as a single Excel

CPU-Only Support ‚Ä¢ No GPU required; optimized for multi-threaded CPU
